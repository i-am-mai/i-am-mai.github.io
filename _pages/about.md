# Definition
The word "me" is used by a speaker to refer to himself or herself as the object of a verb or preposition. For example, take the following sentence:
> Do you understand **me**?

The speaker is referring to themself as the object of the verb "understand", and so uses the word "me".

# Etymology
*Me* has a long and dated history, originating from the Proto-Indo-European *\*h₁me* &rarr; Proto-Germanic *\*miz* &rarr; Proto-West Germanic *\*mir* &rarr; Old English *mē* &rarr; Middle English *me*.

In other words, the word came from absolutely nowhere.
