Recently, I decided to mess around with PSAW, a Python wrapper for the Pushshift Reddit API. All I really planned to do was to gather some random posts from Reddit and see what statistics I could get from it.

# Initial data collection

First, I gathered about 10,000 of the most recent Reddit submissions from all subreddits, and saved the data into a csv file for further analysis.
```python
from psaw import PushshiftAPI
import pandas as pd

api = PushshiftAPI()

gen = api.search_submissions(limit=10000, filter=['url', 'author', 'title', 'subreddit','over_18'])
df = pd.DataFrame([thing.d_ for thing in gen])
df.to_csv('out.csv')
```
Then I did some very minor data analysis with it using pandas. As a quick sample of what the posts were like, I printed the titles of the posts, which gave me some interesting output.

Lo and behold, there were a surprising number of apparently NSFW posts sprinkled throughout, so I did a quick run-through of the posts to see how many were NSFW using the over_18 tag that each post had.

Of the 9,996 posts that I collected, 4,496 of them were NSFW while 5500 were SFW, meaning that about **45% were NSFW** and **55% were SFW**. To me, this was a surprisingly large number and definitely not the split you'd expect while browsing through the front page of Reddit.

# Are they real?

After a quick browse of post titles and authors, I noticed that some of the titles felt kind of like bot-spammy type posts you would usually ignore, so I wanted to know if these were *really* bots. As far as I know, there isn't an easy way to know whether a Reddit account is really a bot or not, but my personal theory is that usually when an account has an auto-generated name and/or is fairly new, it's likely to be a bot.

If you're unfamiliar, what I mean by *auto-generated name* is that when you make a new Reddit account, some names are automatically suggested for you. These names follow a fairly standard pattern that you'll see in the following screenshot, which appears when you make a new account:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2022-07-23_1.png" alt="Reddit's pop-up when you create an account" caption="The pop-up for new account creation"%}

As you can see, the pattern for these auto-generated names is as follows:

**\[Word\](- or \_)\[Word\](- or \_)[3 or 4 numbers]**
{: .text-center}

So, I first used regex to find usernames that matched this criteria, printing the results first to make sure that the expression was right:

```python
for row in df.itertuples():
    if (regex.findall(r"^[A-Z][a-z]+[_\-]?[A-Z][a-z]+[_\-]?[0-9]{3,4}$", row.author)):
        print(row.author)
```
```
Output:
Time_Management_7472
SecureBaker1955
Maximum_Swimmer8112
Glittering_Youth_923
SnooPickles5616
Apprehensive-Use-342
Competitive_Desk7851
Spiritual-Sound-8066
HelpBroad7482
Inevitable-Text-1731
KiwiAccomplished5471
...
```
Then I wanted to see if the NSFW posts had more auto-generated usernames than the SFW ones (and therefore possibly more bots):
```python
nsfw_autogenerated = 0
sfw_autogenerated = 0
for row in df.itertuples():
    if (regex.findall(r"^[A-Z][a-z]+[_\-]?[A-Z][a-z]+[_\-]?[0-9]{3,4}$", row.author)):
        print(f'{row.author}: {row.title}')
        if row.over_18 == True:
            nsfw_autogenerated += 1
        else:
            sfw_autogenerated += 1
```
And it turns out that I was kind of wrong: **19.5% of NSFW posts** had auto-generated usernames, while **18.4% of SFW posts** had auto-generated usernames &mdash; not as large of a difference as I'd expected. This is probably because creating a Reddit account using your Google/Apple account also auto-generates a username for you.

# A plethora of emojis

Something else I noticed is that a lot of the NSFW posts in my data used emojis, like the following:
> 🥵🔥 TIT AF 👀🔥 NEW AND UPDATED STUFF 👀💦 in comments👇👇

which is kind of weird because I'm pretty sure it's not that common to use emojis in Reddit post titles. So, doing a quick run-through of the posts that had emojis:

```python
nsfw_emoji = 0
sfw_emoji = 0
emoji_autogenerated = 0
for row in df.itertuples():
    if (regex.findall(r"\p{Emoji_Presentation}", row.title)):
        print(row.title)
        if (row.over_18):
            nsfw_emoji += 1
        else:
            sfw_emoji += 1
        if (regex.findall(r"^[A-Z][a-z]+[_\-]?[A-Z][a-z]+[_\-]?[0-9]{3,4}$", row.author)):
            emoji_autogenerated += 1
```

I found that of the posts that used emojis, **81.1% of them were NSFW**, while **18.9% were SFW**. Which kind of makes sense, since emojis tend to be more eye-grabbing. Also, **24.2% of posts using emojis had auto-generated usernames**, which is significantly higher than the percentage of auto-generated usernames overall (**18.9%**). Perhaps more of the posts using emojis were created by bots?

# \[Brackets101\]
Something that often appears in Reddit titles is brackets [], at least from what I know. These brackets are usually used to identify someone's gender and age, i.e. \[23F\] would mean a 23 year old female.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2022-07-23_2.png" alt="A post from the 'relationships' subreddit" caption="Sample usage of brackets for gender and age."%}

So, I used the regex to filter the posts that had brackets in the title: 

```
Output:
[G4A] [20] [Discord] Starbrook Chateau - An RP and community server in a unique steampunk setting! Seeking writers of all types, come join us!
[Syphon Filter] #112 Games have come a long way in terms of graphics and controls. I don’t remember this being that bad, but the nostalgia was great.
[1140 The Bet Las Vegas] "I'm not sold on Denver, just because Russell is there. You don't move on from a guy if you're not ready to do it"

28 [M4F] Drinks tonight in Metro

35 [M4F] Do you live to serve, slut?
...
```
And there were actually more posts that used emojis than used brackets (1252 posts vs. 914). Is everything I know about Reddit a lie?

When filtering for SFW vs NSFW, again I found that a higher percentage of posts using brackets were NSFW (69.0%). 

# Subreddit Statistics
To see what subreddits people were posting in, I put all of the subreddits into a dictionary, with the subreddit name being the key, and the number of posts as the value, then sorted the dictionary by value.
``` python
# Some definitely unoptimized code.
subreddits = []
for row in df.itertuples():
    subreddits.append(row.subreddit)
subreddits.sort()

subreddit_frequencies = {}
for item in subreddits:
    if item in subreddit_frequencies.keys():
        subreddit_frequencies[item] += 1
    else:
        subreddit_frequencies[item] = 1

subreddit_frequencies = {k: v for k, v in sorted(subreddit_frequencies.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])}
```
And the top 20 subreddits that were posted in were the following:

```python
# Subreddit: Number of posts
relationship_advice: 23
needysluts: 24
u_eshaxpeashaex: 24
DirtySnapchat: 28
teenagers: 31
jerkbudss: 33
onlyfansgirls101: 33
OnlyfansNewMegaaaa: 42
GaySnapchat: 48
dirtykikpals: 54
dirtyr4r: 54
SluttyOnlyfans: 57
onlyfanshottest: 65
AskReddit: 68
naughtychicks: 71
AdorableOnlyfans: 73
NaughtyOnlyfans: 74
Dhfhfh: 123
tomy69x: 153
Prueba0101: 200
```
Like, what? Of the subreddits here, I only recognized a few: AskReddit, teenagers, and relationship_advice. And the rest seemed to be apparently NSFW subreddits. Two days after I did this analysis, I went back and checked to see what the top-posted subreddit **r/Prueba0101** even was, and was greeted with this page:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2022-07-23_3.png" alt="r/Prueba0101 was banned for violating Reddit rules." %}

I guess the world will never know what the apparently super popular subreddit r/Prueba0101 held <sub>(though I suspect that they may have broken Rule 2: No content manipulation)</sub>

# What did I learn?
That Reddit is apparently full of NSFW content and spammy-botty posts, though this is probably because I took the most recent posts (and therefore posts that hadn't yet had time to be removed). I do hope to do more data analysis with Reddit though, particularly looking at the age of accounts that post.

Here's a link to the data that I collected: [reddit.csv](/assets/data/reddit.csv)
